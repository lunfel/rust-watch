# rust-watch

> NodeJS script to automatically build Rust project on change using Cargo. This is inspired by the webpack-dev-server.

## Install

```bash
npm i -g rust-watch
```

## Usage

At the root of a Cargo initialized Rust project, just run the `rust-watch` command. It will build your project immediately and after every file change in the `src` directory of your project.
